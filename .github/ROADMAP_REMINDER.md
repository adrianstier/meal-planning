# 🎯 BEFORE YOU CODE - READ THIS

## You Are Building a Business, Not Just an App

**Goal**: $100K MRR in 24 months → Sell for $3-5M or earn $50K/month passive income

## Before Making ANY Changes

1. **Check the roadmap**: Does this align with current phase priorities?
2. **Ask the business question**: Will this help acquire, retain, or monetize customers?
3. **Consider opportunity cost**: What else could you build with this time?

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Make It Bulletproof

**Top Priorities**:
1. Stripe payment integration (REVENUE BLOCKER)
2. Premium features (nutrition, analytics, meal prep)
3. Database fixes (prevent future bugs)
4. Testing (prevent customer churn)

## Not Urgent Right Now
- New experimental features
- Code refactoring (unless blocking premium features)
- Nice-to-have UI polish
- Low-priority bugs

## Decision Framework

**Build it now if**:
- ✅ Directly enables revenue (payments, premium features)
- ✅ Critical bug affecting user experience
- ✅ In roadmap Phase 1-2
- ✅ Can ship in <1 week

**Build it later if**:
- ⏳ Nice-to-have feature
- ⏳ In roadmap Phase 3+
- ⏳ No direct revenue impact
- ⏳ Would take >1 week

**Don't build if**:
- ❌ Not in roadmap at all
- ❌ Over-engineering simple features
- ❌ Solving hypothetical future problems
- ❌ Doesn't help get to first paying customer
